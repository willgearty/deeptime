# deeptime: Plotting Tools for Anyone Working in Deep Time

Extends the functionality of other plotting packages (notably 'ggplot2')
to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time intervals,
including, but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological
data. The primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly
customizable timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are
also included to assist with other areas of deep time visualization.
