This minor version adds several new features. I have also moved the data that was added in v. 2.0.0 to a new data R package called `deeptimedata`, which is now on CRAN.

## Test environments (with Github Actions)

* Mac OS X 14.7 (aarch64-apple-darwin20): R 4.4.1
* Ubuntu 22.04.5 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu): R 4.3.3, 4.4.1, and devel (r87233)

* All checks were run separately with ggplot2 3.5.0 and 3.5.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
