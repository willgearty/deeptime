Description: Extends the functionality of other plotting packages like
    'ggplot2' and 'lattice' to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time
    intervals, including, but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological
    data. The primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
    timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also included to assist
    with other areas of deep time visualization.
