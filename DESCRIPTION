Description: Extends the functionality of other plotting packages (notably 'ggplot2')
    to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time intervals, including,
    but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological data. The
    primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
    timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also included to
    assist with other areas of deep time visualization.
