# deeptime (development version)

This new minor version of deeptime introduces several new features and bug fixes.

New features:

* Added default label color values to all built-in data as a new `lab_color` column
  * The label colors are either white or black, whichever has better contrast with the background color based on [recommendations by the International Telecommunication Union](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.601-7-201103-I/en)
* `get_scale_data()` now returns label colors (as above) for Macrostrat timescales
* `facet_wrap_color()` and `facet_grid_color()` now automatically set strip labels to white or black (as above)

Bug fixes:

* Fixed importing some functions from `ggplot2` for `coord_geo_radial()` and `coord_geo_polar()`

# deeptime 2.0.0
__deeptime now requires ggplot2 version 3.5.0 or higher__.\
This new major version of deeptime includes several new features:

* Added FGDC/USGS geologic patterns to internal data (#52)
* Added functions to retrieve and plot FGDC/USGS geologic patterns (#52)
* Added functions to use FGDC/USGS patterns as ggplot2 fills or with the `ggpattern` package (see new vignette) (#52)
* Added the `true_colors` option to `get_scale_data()`, which, when set to `FALSE`, can be used to retrieve the custom Macrostrat colors that were previously in the built-in datasets (#62)
* Updated built-in timescales to 2023/06 version of GTS
* Added option to `coord_geo()` to abbreviate interval labels based on only the intervals that are being plotted (#64)
* Added `guide_geo()` as an alternative to `coord_geo()`, mostly for use with radial plots (#53)

Bug fixes:

* Fixed the built-in timescale datasets to have true CGMP colors for the Precambrian (#62)

Notable changes:

* The `phytools` package is no longer required to install `deeptime` but is required to use the `geom_phylomorpho()` function
* The `geomtextpath` package is no longer required to install `deeptime` but is required to add labels with the `coord_geo_polar()` or `coord_geo_radial()` functions
* The `gggeo_scale_old()` function has been fully deprecated

# deeptime 1.1.1
deeptime now requires rlang version 1.1.0 or higher. This patch version includes several bug fixes:

* Fixed several cases where vignette and documentation building and/or unit testing would fail when the Macrostrat API was down
* Fixed `coord_geo_polar()` and `coord_geo_radial()` when the r-axis has expansion (#60)
* Improved argument type checking and error handling across the entire package

# deeptime 1.1.0
deeptime now requires ggplot2 version 3.4.0 or higher. This version introduces several new features and bug fixes:

* Added `geom_points_range()`, a function designed for visualizing temporal occurrence data
* Added `facet_grid_color()` and `facet_wrap_color()` for changing strip background colors (#50)
* Added `coord_geo_radial()`, an enhanced version of `coord_geo_polar()` (only works with ggplot2 version 3.5.0 and higher) (#56)
* Added `family` and `fontface` arguments to `coord_geo()`
* Added the ability to include interval labels with `coord_geo_polar()` (#48)
* Fixed the interaction between `coord_geo()` and `ggsave()` (#49)
* Fixed `size = "auto"` when `center_end_labels = TRUE` in `coord_geo()`
* Updated several functions to work with ggplot2 version 3.5.0

Notable changes:

* The names for the theme elements that are used for `coord_geo_polar()` are now prepended with "deeptime." (e.g., `deeptime.axis.line.r`) (#51)
* ggplot2 version 3.5.0 has broken several edge cases of `coord_trans_xy()`. See the documentation for more details. This will be fixed in a future deeptime release.

* Soft deprecated `gggeo_scale()` and `gggeo_scale_old()`

# deeptime 0.3.0

* Fixed handling of axis tick labels for coord_trans_xy (#31)

# deeptime 0.0.5

* Updated examples and documentation to use `coord_geo()`
* Added `coord_trans_xy()`, which is a coordinate system for `ggplot2` that is similar to `coord_trans()` but allows for 2-dimensional transformations
* Added `disparity_through_time()` which allows for plotting 2-dimensional data across a 3rd dimension (using `lattice`)

# deeptime 0.0.4
`ggarrange2()` now accepts `geo_scale` objects and other grobified ggplots
